<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- The compiler and runtime of this language. For now there is no version available, but you can clone this repository and compile yourself !

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/RedGear-Studio/Reg-Lang.git
   ```
2. Later...

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

> There is no documentation for the moment. The language is still in early phase of development.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] To be simple to help learning programmation with, and in a second hand, to be robust enough to power complex software.
> Maybe ? (lmao yes obviously)

- [ ] Both interpreted and compiled.
> The interpreter is nearly ready to go!

- [ ] Dymanicaly and statically typed (You can choose the one you want).
> Need to check again if we keep that or not

> There gonna be a `Any` Type, so the Dynamic typing can be used with that

- [ ] Live programming.
> A prototype for that is being written... just need to w8 a bit.

- [ ] To provide a new type of asynchronous operations.
> No real idea for now...

- [ ] New type of Debugger, more simpler for the programmer.
> Ideas but nothing more...

- [ ] Lot of librairies to help building complex software such as a Math, Science, Game Engine ones for example.
> The prototype is nearly finished... just need to w8 a bit.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/RedGear-Studio/Reg-Lang/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
